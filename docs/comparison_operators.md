# Comparison Operators in C

Comparison operators in C are used to compare values and conditions in conditional statements. They return a Boolean value, which is either `true` (1) or `false` (0). In C, the common comparison operators include:

## Logical AND (`&&`)

The logical AND operator `&&` is used to combine two conditions. It returns `true` if both conditions are true; otherwise, it returns `false`.

```c
if (condition1 && condition2) {
    // Code to execute if both conditions are true
} else {
    // Code to execute if at least one condition is false
}
```

## Logical NOT (`!`)

```c
if (!condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```
## Logical OR (`||`)

```c
if (condition1 || condition2) {
    // Code to execute if at least one of the conditions is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if both conditions are false
}
```
